Here are ideas about how package "resolver" is designed:
    1. Resolver plays the role of Controller in a traditional MVC and 3 tiers design. Resolvers do not user the
    controller annotation, as the routing to different resolvers is depending on the function names. Resolvers are
    responsible for calling corresponding services to deal with the request coming in and return the data to frontend.

    2. For a good design, do not use DAO in resolvers as we treat it as a controller layer.
